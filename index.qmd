5. Efficacy

## Summary/Discussion

- Significant conceptual leap from 3+3 to model-based designs

- Probability of CRM correctly identifying MTD increases with sample size

- Typical to constrain model-based recommendations to maximize patient safety [@goodman.sim]
    * Cohorts of size $>1$ at each dose level (moderates dose escalation)
    * Never escalate more than one dose level per patient
    * Never assign dose $j$ when its estimated rated of DLT exceeds $p_T$ by some tolerance

- Concept of patient horizon, e.g. @simon.biometrics
